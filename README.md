# Noop Packages
A list of a lot of the noop packages on NPM and their differences. If you find any more, please file an issue!
If you need help deciding which one to use, just file an issue with your exact context and everything and we'll answer.

Note: noop5 is not included because it only works in TypeScript, and co-noop is not included because it's a generator function, and none is not included even though it's a noop, because it's meant for performance and not to be used as a noop.


| Package | Type                   | Usage | Motto | Additional Exported Values    | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|-------|-------|-------------------------|---|
| [`noop`](https://ghub.io/noop)  | Regular function declaration with name | `require('noop')` <br>`noop()`| Provides a few global functions such as noop, throwop, and doop | `throwop`, `doop` | Functions are put on global scope and not exported |
| [`noop2`](https://ghub.io/noop2)  | Regular function declaration with name | `const noop = require('noop2')` <br>`noop()`| No operation as a module‚Ñ¢. | none | Function is pre-called in file that exports it |
| [`noop3`](https://ghub.io/noop3) | Anonymous arrow function created with another factory function in the source code | `const noop = require('noop3')`<br>`noop()` | ‚óªÔ∏è Supreme nothingness | none | In its source code uses a factory that returns a noop function which is in a  separate file and can also be imported |
| [`noop4`](https://npmjs.com/package/noop4) | Anonymous regular function declaration that has to be created by calling a factory | `const noop = require('noop4')`<br>`noop()()` | No operation avoiding references. | none | Deprecated, and actually exports a factory that you have to call to get a noop function. It's a noop that avoids references. |
| [`noop6`](https://ghub.io/noop6) | Anonymous regular function declaration | `const noop = require('noop6')`<br>`noop()` | No operation as a module using an arrow function. | none | Doesn't actually use an arrow function. It may appear to, because it does in the GitHub repo, but if you go to the code tab in the NPM package it doesn't use an arrow function. |
| [`noop7`](https://npmjs.com/package/noop7) | Anonymous arrow function created with another factory function in the source code | `const noop = require('noop7')`<br>`noop()` | ‚óªÔ∏è Supreme nothingness | none | An exact clone of `noop3` that is deprecated with message "testing" |
| [`noop8`](https://npmjs.com/package/noop8) | Anonymous arrow function created with another factory function in the source code | `const noop = require('noop8')`<br>`noop()` | ‚óªÔ∏è Supreme nothingness | none | An exact clone of `noop3` that is not deprecated |
| [`noop9`](https://npmjs.com/package/noop9) | Anonymous arrow function created with another factory function in the source code | `const noop = require('noop9')`<br>`noop()` | ‚óªÔ∏è Supreme nothingness | none | An exact clone of `noop3` that is deprecated with message "testing" |
| [`noop10`](https://github.com/tj-commits/noop10) | Anonymous arrow function | `const noop = require('noop10')`<br>`noop()` | No operation as a module using an arrow function. | none | none |
| [`nop`](https://ghub.io/nop) | Regular function declaration with name | `const nop = require('nop')` <br>`nop()`| a library for providing a javascript function that does nothing; it's like super useful | none | none |
| [`no-op`](https://ghub.io/no-op) | Regular function declaration with name | `const noop = require('no-op')` <br>`noop()`| one no-op function to rule them all | none | none |
| [`node-noop`](https://ghub.io/node-noop) | Anonymous regular function declaration | `const noop = require('node-noop')`<br>`noop()`| Implements a noop function | none | none |

| [`yanoop`](https://ghub.io/yanoop) | Anonymous regular function declaration with a name defined after a colon in an object | `const { noop } = require('yanoop')`<br>`noop()` | Yet another noop utility package | `throwop`, `doop` | Basically the same as `noop`, except not defined globally and instead exported, still exporting the same three functions. |
| [`true-noop`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/true-noop) | Function.prototype | `const noop = require('true-noop')`<br>`noop()` | The only *true* 'no operation' module out there. | none | Exports Function.prototype, as that is a function that does nothing. The only problem with this is that if you put properties on this noop, it will add them to `Function.prototype` which will add them whenever you make a function. |
| [`async.util.noop`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async.util.noop) | Regular function declaration with name | `const noop = require('async.util.noop')`<br>`noop()` | async noop helper method as module. | none | Supposedly used by `async`. |

Actually exports both but you're meant to just use the one like in the usage. |
| [`empty`](https://ghub.io/empty) | Anonymous regular function declaration. | `const noop = require('empty').func`<br>`noop()` | Utility that provides different types of empty objects. | `object`, `array`, `functionThatReturns`, `functionThatReturnsTrue`, `functionThatReturnsFalse`, `functionThatReturnsNull`, `functionThatReturnsThis`, `functionThatReturnsArgument` | Is just a package with lots of empty and almost empty values and noop function is one of them. |
